<h>Hi, my name is George. I am currently trying to learn coding, and maybe even making my own website on this site. I am self-teaching myself and it is fairly difficult for me. However, with some consistency I am sure I am do well. Over time, of couse.</h>

<p>
As I am learning this, I will look for other ways to improve my coding skills. I believe for right now I just need to focus on doing all of this. That way I can finish my own projects, I think I will have more fun learning that.
